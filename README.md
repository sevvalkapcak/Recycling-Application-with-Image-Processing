# Recycling Application with Image Processing
Recycling Mobile Application with Image Processing. The application automatically identifies and categorizes recyclable materials such as paper, metal, and plastic from user-uploaded photos. It encourages users to recycle by offering points and rewards for their efforts.
 
The classification section for recycling with image processing is written in Python. Six different categories—glass, metal, battery, paper, plastic, and biological—have been classified. A dataset downloaded from Kaggle was used for this purpose. First, unnecessary categories were cleaned, and images that could cause confusion were removed. The three categories of white, green, and brown glass were merged under the "glass" category, and the number of data points was reduced to be similar to other categories to prevent overfitting. The model was then trained with the dataset, and its performance was tested.
